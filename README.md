# Programmed Eyes

This project was an exercise in using programmatically defining and placing two simple images of eyes on the page, and making the eyeballs follow the mouse pointer. Each eye is comprised of an "eye" (the white part) and a "ball" (the black part). 

How to run:
<ol>
  <li>Not much to this, just move your mouse :)</li>
</ol>

Roadmap:
<ol>
  <li>Add an onclick event to reposition the eyes on the page.</li>
</ol>
